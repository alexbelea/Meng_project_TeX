\chapter{Acknowledgements}


We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our supervisors, Dr. Roberto Ramirez-Iniguez and Geraint Bevan, for their invaluable guidance and unwavering support throughout this project.

Our appreciation extends to the 3rd Floor EEE Lab Technicians and Dr. Carlos Gamio-Roffe, whose technical expertise and assistance were instrumental in the successful construction of the prototype.

We are particularly grateful to the European Project Semester RED Team members—Nikolay Ivanov Shopov, Stef Hannisse, and Samridhi Gupta—for generously allowing the use of their Renewable Energy Demonstrator as a testbench. Their contribution provided an ideal platform for positioning light sources during the testing phase of this project.
