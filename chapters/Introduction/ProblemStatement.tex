\section{Problem Statement}
With the ever-increasing commercialization of the space and satellite industry there is a growing need for a cost-effective method of attitude tracking for smaller satellite missions of such as CubeSat as these missions are purpose built for very specific objectives. Whilst the larger commercial satellite missions make use of expensive digital camera systems for tracking purposes, this is not feasible for much smaller CubeSat setups. CubeSats are defined from 1 unit to 12 -- where 1U is a 10x10x10 cm satellite. Consequently, there is a demand for a cost-effective and easily implementable attitude tracking system that can provide accurate measurements for CubeSat missions, such as a Position Sensitive Detector (PSD) using photodiodes.
