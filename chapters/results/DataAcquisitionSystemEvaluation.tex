\section{\acf{DAQ} System Evaluation}
The \ac{DAQ} was considered a success, it was able to take recordings in realtime of all four photodiodes and send them to a computer for post-processing. In it's final design the overal system that included the Python script as well as the Arduino, was able to perform it's task of generating both data in csv format that allowed comparison with simulated input, as well as the addition of noise filtering. % maybe add \ref to figures with graph 

% % Include a flowchart
