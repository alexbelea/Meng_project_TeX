\section{Enclosure Effectiveness}
The final design of the enclosure is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CADFinal}.
 The enclosure was designed and modified throughout its various iterations to be lightweight and portable, while still providing adequate protection for the internal components. 
 The design also allowed for easy access to the internal components for maintenance and troubleshooting.
 The enclosure was deemed a successful design as it met the requirements of being a stable and portable platform for the internal components, as in the Photodiode array.
 Problems with previous designs were addressed in the final design iteration, such as the need for a easier access to the anode and cathode connections of the photodiode array, which was achieved by using a removable cover, the rail-lock system, for the enclosure.
 This system allowed for the photodiode array to be easily mounted and secured into position.
 This system also allowed for the height of the enclosure to be adjusted so that surface that mounted the glass and the aperture was at a suitable height for when it was in use with the RED testbench.
