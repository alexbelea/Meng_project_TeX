\subsection{Functional Requirements}

A Python model was constructed to provide a simulation of the movement and intersection of rays from a movable source to evaluate sensor performance and compare these results with practical experiments.
The model allows for a number of configurable parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Trajectory of the light source in 3D space, which moves in configurable discrete increments.
    \item Placement, dimensions, and quantity of any number of sensors and apertures.
    \item Output visualisation, as a static, or animated graphic.
\end{itemize}
Affording flexibility for the model to simulate any sensor topology under a variety of conditions.
