\section{Amplification Performance}
As seen previously during iteration, the amplification circuit was able to correctly transduce and amplify the current from the photodiodes. The results in complete darkness measurement can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:ampPerf}, the output voltage across all photodiodes is measured as well, below.

A recording is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:recZoom} showing the recording of a sampling with the light moving at 0.2Hz with the arch at 90\textdegree and the LED strip going across from near 0\textdegree to near 180\textdegree. This result was considered good, as when compared to simulation, it was very similar.
