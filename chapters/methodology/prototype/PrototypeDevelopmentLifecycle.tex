\subsubsection*{Conceptualization and Requirements Definition}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The prototype must have four photodiodes in an xy pattern with respective circuitry required to output ~0-5 Volts that will be read by an Arduino based DataAcquisitionSystem (DAQ). The circuit must be able to react to light intensity changes, however the change will be at low frequency ( below 1Hz) as a satellite attitude is considered to change only gradually.
  \item While the prototype may not have a high accuracy, it is hoped that it will be enough to measure light position changes.  
  \item The prototype within the scope of this paper will show the ability to detect the position of light at normal room conditions, therefore it does not need to withstand temperature changes or radiation that a final product would require if deployed in space.
  \item Interface requirements: the prototype electrical output needs to be compatible with the Arduino Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) input. Therefore, the signal shall not go below 0 Volts or exeed 5 volts. 
  \item Size and weight are not of high importance, but the device must fit in the testing equipment, which is the Renewable Energy Demonstrator arch. Preferably a height not higher than 5cm.
