\section{System xyz Methodology}

% 1. Functional Requirements
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
Contains a detailed list of what the system must do from the user's perspective. This includes user stories, use cases, and feature descriptions that clearly define system behaviors, inputs, outputs, and how users will interact with the system.
% 2. Design Approach
\subsection{Design Approach}
Outlines the overall strategy for designing the system, including architectural patterns, design principles, and key technology choices. This explains the rationale behind major design decisions and how they align with requirements.
% 3. Technical Specifications
\subsection{Technical Specifications}
Provides the detailed technical blueprint for implementation. Includes system architecture diagrams, data models, API definitions, algorithms, and specific technologies to be used. Translates the "what" into the "how" with precise technical parameters.
% 4. Implementation Plan
\subsection{Implementation Plan}
Describes how the development will be executed, including task breakdown, timeline, resource allocation, and development methodology (Agile, Waterfall, etc.). Outlines milestones, dependencies, and critical path activities.
% 5. Testing Strategy
\subsection{Testing Strategy}
Details the approach to validate that the system meets requirements. Includes test types (unit, integration, system, user acceptance), test environments, test data, automation approach, and quality metrics to ensure comprehensive coverage.
% 6. Deployment Process
\subsection{Deployment Process}
Specifies how the solution will be moved from development to production. Includes deployment steps, required environments, rollout strategy, rollback procedures, and post-deployment verification.
% 7. Evaluation & Feedback Loop(?)
\subsection{Evaluation & Feedback Loop}
Describes how system performance and user satisfaction will be measured. Includes success metrics, monitoring approach, feedback collection methods, and processes for incorporating learnings into future iterations.
