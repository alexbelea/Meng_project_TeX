\subsection{Lifecycle}
This section provides an overview of the Prototype Development Lifecycle.

\subsubsection*{Conceptualization and Requirements Definition}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The prototype must have four photodiodes in an xy pattern with respective circuitry required to output ~0-5 Volts that will be read by an Arduino based Data Acquisition System (DAQ). The circuit must be able to react to light intensity changes, however the change will be at low frequency ( below 1Hz) as a satellite attitude is considered to change only gradually.
  \item While the prototype may not have a high accuracy, it is hoped that it will be enough to measure light position changes roughly, even if at a low accuracy of ~10° or ~20° but this will remain to be seen.  
  \item The prototype within the scope of this paper will show the ability to detect the position of light at normal room conditions, therefore it does not need to withstand temperature changes or radiation that a final product would require if deployed in space.
  \item Interface requirements: the prototype electrical output needs to be compatible with the Arduino Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) input. Therefore, the signal shall not go below 0 Volts or exeed 5 volts. 
  \item Size and weight are not of high importance, but the device must fit in the testing equipment, which is the Renewable Energy Demonstrator arch. Preferably a height not higher than 5cm.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Theoretical Design}

\paragraph{Photodiodes} were researched and several options were found, most of which were quite expensive, such as 2D PSD type sensors like the Hamamatsu S5990 but were both prohibitivly expensive and Surface Mount Device style (SMD), which would have been harder to prototype but would allow for much higher resolutions, while also complicating the project. A decision was made to base the project on 1D photodiodes, and four Hamamatsu S5971 were purchased, which offered a good compromise in price and specifications: for under £10 a piece, the S5971 has the following specifications:

\begin{table}[h]

  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
  \hline

  \hline
  Noise equivalent power NEP ($V_R$=10 V, $\lambda$=$\lambda_p$) & 7.4 $\times$ 10$^{-15}$ W/Hz$^{1/2}$ \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \begin{tablenotes}

  \end{tablenotes}
  \end{table}

Although the higher versions such as S5972-3 have better specifications, such as frequency cutoff of 1GHz and lower Dark current, these were not needed for our project, higher frequency cut off not needed due the static nature of the light source and dark current, while it could affect a case where one of the diodes is fully in the dark, a voltage offeset would be noticeable, but with a voltage resolution restricted by the Arduino DAQ to 4.88mV/step, it was deemed acceptable:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:darkCurrentOffset}
  \begin{split}
V_\text{offset-TIA} &= I_d \times R_f \\
&= 0.07 \text{ nA} \times 1 \text{ M}\Omega \\
&= 70 \text{ }\mu\text{V}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
\addequation{DC Offset Voltage at TIA Output Due to Dark Current}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:totalDCoffset}
  \begin{split}
V_\text{offset-total} &= V_\text{offset-TIA} \times \text{Gain}_\text{post-amp} \\
&= 70 \text{ }\mu\text{V} \times 16 \\
&= 1.12 \text{ mV}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
\addequation{Total DC Offset After Post-Amplification}
Equation \ref{eq:totalDCoffset} above shows the final dark current would be a maximum of 1.12mV which is below what the ADC can detect. 

\paragraph{Sun Sensor Geometry and Aperture Design} was decided to be in a T shape, providing an x-y layout with two photodiodes in the x direction and two photodiodes in the y direction. Combined with an aperture design that covers one half of each diode, as represented in Figure \ref{fig:diodeApertureDiagram}.
