	abstract={Additive manufacturing (or 3D printing) involves the process of fabricating a part by layer-by-layer assembly of materials with processes such as extrusion, binding, melting, and photopolymerization. It is transforming how we assemble our prototypes and, in the future, manufacture our products. There have been a number of materials that can be utilized for this technology, however, high performance polymer nanocomposites are a very important class of material that is just recently being used in additive manufacturing. High performance polymer is a group of polymer materials that are known to retain its desirable mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties when subjected to harsh environment such as high temperature, high pressure, and corrosive chemicals. When mixed with nanofillers such as carbon nanotube, nanoclay, and graphene, these polymers can have improved mechanical properties and sometimes acquire properties that were not present initially like thermal and electrical conductivity. This review article aims to summarize available additive manufacturing techniques, high performance polymers and nanofillers available, and research efforts on its use for additive manufacturing.},

	abstract = 	 {Rapid prototyping (RP) or layered manufacturing (LM) technologies have been extensively used to manufacture prototypes composed mainly of plastics, polymers, paper, and wax due to the short product development time and low costs of these technologies. However, such technologies, with the exception of selective laser melting and sintering, are not used to fabricate metallic products because of the resulting poor life, short cycle, poor surface finish, and low structural integrity of the fabricated parts. The properties endowed by these parts do not match those of functional parts. Therefore, extensive research has been conducted to develop new additive manufacturing (AM) technologies by extending existing RP technologies. Several AM technologies have been developed for the fabrication of metallic objects. These technologies utilize materials, such as Ni-, Al-, and Ti-based alloys and stainless steel powders, to fabricate high-quality functional components. The present work reviews the type of materials used in laserbased AM processes for the manufacture of metallic products. The advantages and disadvantages of processes and different materials are summarized, and future research directions are discussed in the final section. This review can help experts select the ideal type of process or technology for the manufacturing of elements composed of a given alloy or material (Ni, Ti, Al, Pb, and stainless steel).},

	abstract={The mechanical properties of the stent are of key importance to the mechanical integrity and performance reliability of stentplaque-artery system, and an ideal stent should have good bending compliance, axial deformation stability, hoop strength and stiffness, larger radial expandable ability, etc. In this paper, innovative chiral stent designs with auxetic properties are proposed, and amplified stent sample is fabricated with SLS additive manufacturing technique. Firstly, through combining micro-CT tomography and image-based finite element analysis, the mechanical properties of as fabricated SLS stent are explored; Secondly, two series of stent samples are fabricated with SLS additive manufacturing techniques, and in-situ compression experiments are performed for studying the deformation mechanisms and auxetic mechanical behaviors of stents. Finally, effects of geometrical parameters on the tensile mechanical performance of these stents are studied with finite element analysis. The proposed chiral stent exhibits auxetic behaviors, and can be tailored through adjusting the unit cell design parameters, such as: struct numbers along circumferential directions, ligament lengths, and node radius.},

	abstract={Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to propose and evaluate the selection of materials for the selective laser sintering (SLS) process, which is used for low-volume production in the engineering (e.g. light weight machines, architectural modelling, high performance application, manufacturing of fuel cell, etc.), medical and many others (e.g. art and hobbies, etc.) with a keen focus on meeting customer requirements. Design/methodology/approach-The work starts with understanding the optimal process parameters, an appropriate consolidation mechanism to control microstructure, and selection of appropriate materials satisfying the property requirement for specific application area that leads to optimization of materials. Findings-Fabricating the parts using optimal process parameters, appropriate consolidation mechanism and selecting the appropriate material considering the property requirement of applications can improve part characteristics, increase acceptability, sustainability, life cycle and reliability of the SLS-fabricated parts. Originality/value-The newly proposed material selection system based on properties requirement of applications has been proven, especially in cases where non-experts or student need to select SLS process materials according to the property requirement of applications. The selection of materials based on property requirement of application may be used by practitioners from not only the engineering field, medical field and many others like art and hobbies but also academics who wish to select materials of SLS process for different applications.},

	abstract={An up-to-date, comprehensive guide for advanced electrical engineering students and electrical engineers working in the IC and optical industries This book covers the major transimpedance amplifier (TIA) topologies and their circuit implementations for optical receivers. This includes the shunt-feedback TIA, common-base TIA, common-gate TIA, regulated-cascode TIA, distributed-amplifier TIA, nonresistive feedback TIA, current-mode TIA, burst-mode TIA, and analog-receiver TIA. The noise, transimpedance, and other performance parameters of these circuits are analyzed and optimized. Topics of interest include post amplifiers, differential vs. single-ended TIAs, DC input current control, and adaptive transimpedance. The book features real-world examples of TIA circuits for a variety of receivers (direct detection, coherent, burst-mode, etc.) implemented in a broad array of technologies (HBT, BiCMOS, CMOS, etc.). The book begins with an introduction to optical communication systems, signals, and standards. It then moves on to discussions of optical fiber and photodetectors. This discussion includes p-i-n photodetectors; avalanche photodetectors (APD); optically preamplified detectors; integrated detectors, including detectors for silicon photonics; and detectors for phase-modulated signals, including coherent detectors. This is followed by coverage of the optical receiver at the system level: the relationship between noise, sensitivity, optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR), and bit-error rate (BER) is explained; receiver impairments, such as intersymbol interference (ISI), are covered. In addition, the author presents TIA specifications and illustrates them with example values from recent product data sheets. The book also includes: Many numerical examples throughout that help make the material more concrete for readers Real-world product examples that show the performance of actual IC designs Chapter summaries that highlight the key points Problems and their solutions for readers who want to practice and deepen their understanding of the material Appendices that cover communication signals, eye diagrams, timing jitter, nonlinearity, adaptive equalizers, decision point control, forward error correction (FEC), and second-order low-pass transfer functions Analysis and Design of Transimpedance Amplifiers for Optical Receivers belongs on the reference shelves of every electrical engineer working in the IC and optical industries.

	journal={MATEC Web of Conferences},
	volume={137},
	abstract={Each printing method and the materials used for prototype construction have distinct advantages and drawbacks. A large part of the 3D printer producers indicates high printing accuracy (positioning accuracies from 100 µm up to 1 µm and layer thickness from 100 µm tо 5 µm). In the process of layers deposition, the material is softened, melted or irradiated with a certain light source to polymerize. Thus, during the printing process, the volume of the materials is changing causing shrinking or expansion which often leads to the occurrence of precision errors in the prototype as opposed to the digital model. This phenomenon leads to distortions of the printed object known as a curling effect. Certain chemical compounds are added by the producers to multiple materials in order to enhance their mechanical and technological properties. However, this often results in changes of some printing parameters influencing the precision and quality of the manufactured object. The aim of the particular study is to establish the allowances with regard to the accuracy during manufacturing precise objects used in micro technologies as well as the necessary adjustments in dimensions because of the shrinkage and the positioning of the SLA 3D printed parts from photopolymer material.},

Here, our purpose is to demonstrate the effects of the modeling methods on the dimensional accuracy and precision. A component having cylindrical, plane and amorphous surfaces have been selected as a sample material. Polyjet and FDM methods have been used in 3D printer using the nominal data of this component. Then a 3D scanner have been used to scan those aforementioned parts. These scans have been remodeled with two different modeling methods, namely, ASm and Pm. After modeling, the measured (scan) data has been compared with the nominal data. Differences in terms of the size of the results were revealed mathematically. According to the results obtained, when we compare the parts produced by Polyjet by ASm and Pm methods, we observe that ASm gives better results all over the surface than Pm. Also, the former one has less maximum error norm than the later one. On the other hand the samples produced by FDM using both ASm and Pm give better results all over the surface, but the former one has relatively less maximum error norm than the later one.},

Small-scale features are essential in many applications such as microfluidics, microelectronics, and biomedical devices.

	abstract={Space electronics play a pivotal role in enabling modern space missions, facilitating communication, navigation, remote sensing, and scientific exploration. However, the extreme conditions of space, including temperature variations, radiation exposure, and mechanical stresses, pose significant challenges for the materials used in electronic components. This conceptual review explores the next-generation materials for space electronics, aiming to address these challenges and push the boundaries of performance and reliability. The review begins by outlining the fundamental requirements for space electronics materials, emphasizing the need for extreme temperature resistance, radiation shielding, mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. It then surveys the current state-of-the-art materials, including silicon-based materials, compound semiconductors, polymers, ceramics, and composites, highlighting their strengths and limitations in space applications. Furthermore, the review discusses emerging materials and technologies, such as 2D materials, organic electronics, quantum materials, and metamaterials, which hold promise for revolutionizing space electronics. Implementation strategies are proposed, considering factors like integration with existing systems, scalability, cost-effectiveness, environmental impact, and regulatory compliance. Through this conceptual review, insights are provided into the potential applications of next-generation materials in satellites, space probes, exploration missions, and beyond. The conclusion summarizes key findings, underscores potential implications for the future of space electronics, and offers recommendations for further research and development. By advancing the state of materials science for space electronics, this review aims to contribute to the ongoing exploration and utilization of space for the benefit of humanity.},

	abstract={Implementation of Attitude determination and control system for 1 u cube-sat in polar sun circular orbit is proposed. ADCS plays an important role in maintaining the orientation (stabilizing) of the satellite in the desired attitude. The Algorithms responsible for attitude determination such as IGRF, J2000, Sun sensor, Magnetometer, Gyroscope were simulated using Matlab. The Orbital parameters were calculated for an attitude of 505km with 98 degree inclination. Using the above simulation and outputs of different algorithm the control algorithm named BDOT algorithm was simulated. The simulation of algorithms were done on MATLAB 2022A and the results suggest that the 1 U Nano Satellite would Stabilize within 2000 sec in the orbit.},

	title={Thermal Simulation of a CubeSat},
	abstract={This paper presents a thermal analysis and control framework for a cubesat which can serve as an on-orbit experimental platform on living mammalian tissues. In particular, the Bio-CubeSat will be used to study long term effects of space radiations and microgravity on a living sample of mammalian bone tissue contained in a bio housing. This housing will provide the adequate ex-vivo environment for the tissue to survive during the few weeks to perform the experiments. It will also contain the set of sensors to assess the health of the sample and its structural change and chemical degradation due to the harsh space environment. One of the most stringent requirements, for the survivability of the bone sample, relates to maintaining the housing temperature fluctuation within a narrow range during the orbit. In this work we describe the development of a framework to execute the thermal analysis of an orbiting cubesat. Our ultimate goal is to identify, for a given Bio-cubesat orbit, the external coating materials and attitude control law, during the Sun exposure, that limit the temperature fluctuation within an admissible range.}

	abstract={This research paper offers a thorough structural analysis of a 1U CubeSat using ANSYS ®. It focuses on the loads encountered during launch, rocket stage separation, and CubeSat deployment. The study examines the CubeSat's structural behavior under various load types, including static, modal, random vibration, and shock loads. Utilizing ANSYS ® , a highly reliable finite element analysis software, renowned for its precision, the investigation was conducted. The outcomes yield vital insights into the CubeSat's structural performance. This encompasses its natural frequencies, vibration modes, and reactions to random vibration and shock loads throughout mission phases. Given the pivotal role of structural analysis in the successful operation of CubeSats in space, this paper significantly contributes to their design and analysis for space missions. Furthermore, it establishes a methodological framework for CubeSat structural analysis using ANSYS ® , serving as a valuable reference for future CubeSat endeavors.},

In addition to their significant role in educating space scientists and engineers, CubeSats provide a low-cost platform for testing and space qualification of the next generation of small payloads in space. A key component of the project is the development of a standard CubeSat deployer. This deployer is capable of releasing a number of CubeSats as secondary payloads on a wide range of launchers. The standard deployer requires all CubeSats to conform to common physical requirements, and share a standard deployer interface. CubeSat development time and cost can be significantly reduced by the development of standards that are shared by a large number of spacecraft. TABLE OF CONTENTS 1. INTRODUCTION 3.

	abstract={In recent years, the space industry has witnessed a resurgence, characterized by a notable proliferation of satellites operating at progressively lower altitudes, promising extensive global coverage and terrestrial-level data transfer speeds, while remaining cost-effective solutions. In particular, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can benefit from the wide coverage of space infrastructure due to their extensive deployment, disrupted communication nature, and the potential absence of terrestrial support. This study explored the utility of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations as a communication infrastructure for interconnecting "smart" devices via ground stations in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. To this end, we designed and implemented a series of experiments conducted within the OMNeT++ simulator, utilizing an updated iteration of the original Open Source Satellite Simulator (OS3) framework. Our research encompassed an IoT Case Study, incorporating authentic sensor data sourced from the Smart Santander testbed. Throughout our experimentation, we investigated the impact of the constellation design parameters such as the number of satellites and orbital planes, as well as the inter-satellite link configuration on the obtained Round-Trip Time (RTT) and packet loss rates.},

The sensor used consists of two-dimensional array of photodiodes. The sensor has four output photocurrents that change according to the position of incident radiation on the surface. The work is divided into three parts of Modeling and Simulation; the first part is a single photodiode, Second part is one-dimensional array of photodiodes and the third one is two-dimensional array of photodiodes. The tool used to do the simulation is MATLAB software because it is professional and accurate tool, it has photodiode element and it is possible to control the beam of incident light. This research can be useful for Acquisition; Pointing and Tracking (APT) systems where this sensor will give the necessary data to do tracking operation.
