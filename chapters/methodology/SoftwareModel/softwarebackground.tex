\section{Software Model}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

A Python model was constructed to provide a simulation of the movement and intersection of rays from a movable source to evaluate sensor performance and compare these results with practical experiments.
The model allows for a number of configurable parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Trajectory of the light source 3D space, which moves in configurable discrete increments.
    \item Placement of any number of sensors and apertures, including their dimensions.
    \item Output visualisation, as a static, or animated graphic.
\end{itemize}
Affording flexibility for the model to simulate any sensor topology under a variety of conditions.
