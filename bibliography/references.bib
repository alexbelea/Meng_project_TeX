	title={Thermal Simulation of a CubeSat},
	abstract={This paper presents a thermal analysis and control framework for a cubesat which can serve as an on-orbit experimental platform on living mammalian tissues. In particular, the Bio-CubeSat will be used to study long term effects of space radiations and microgravity on a living sample of mammalian bone tissue contained in a bio housing. This housing will provide the adequate ex-vivo environment for the tissue to survive during the few weeks to perform the experiments. It will also contain the set of sensors to assess the health of the sample and its structural change and chemical degradation due to the harsh space environment. One of the most stringent requirements, for the survivability of the bone sample, relates to maintaining the housing temperature fluctuation within a narrow range during the orbit. In this work we describe the development of a framework to execute the thermal analysis of an orbiting cubesat. Our ultimate goal is to identify, for a given Bio-cubesat orbit, the external coating materials and attitude control law, during the Sun exposure, that limit the temperature fluctuation within an admissible range.}

	title={Structural Analysis of 1U CubeSat Designed for Low Earth Orbit Missions},
	publisher={IEEE},
	pages={1},
	abstract={This research paper offers a thorough structural analysis of a 1U CubeSat using ANSYS ®. It focuses on the loads encountered during launch, rocket stage separation, and CubeSat deployment. The study examines the CubeSat's structural behavior under various load types, including static, modal, random vibration, and shock loads. Utilizing ANSYS ® , a highly reliable finite element analysis software, renowned for its precision, the investigation was conducted. The outcomes yield vital insights into the CubeSat's structural performance. This encompasses its natural frequencies, vibration modes, and reactions to random vibration and shock loads throughout mission phases. Given the pivotal role of structural analysis in the successful operation of CubeSats in space, this paper significantly contributes to their design and analysis for space missions. Furthermore, it establishes a methodological framework for CubeSat structural analysis using ANSYS ® , serving as a valuable reference for future CubeSat endeavors.},

	abstract = 	 {Cal Poly students are participating in the development of a new class of picosatellite, the CubeSat. CubeSats are ideal as space development projects for universities around the world. In addition to their significant role in educating space scientists and engineers, CubeSats provide a low-cost platform for testing and space qualification of the next generation of small payloads in space. A key component of the project is the development of a standard CubeSat deployer. This deployer is capable of releasing a number of CubeSats as secondary payloads on a wide range of launchers. The standard deployer requires all CubeSats to conform to common physical requirements, and share a standard deployer interface. CubeSat development time and cost can be significantly reduced by the development of standards that are shared by a large number of spacecraft. TABLE OF CONTENTS 1. INTRODUCTION 3.

Low Earth Orbit (LEO) case studies are proposed, and the level of catastrophic failure occurrence is quantified for the same mission duration. The variation in the occurrence of failures is studied and there is a determination of which is more likely. Emphasis is placed on examining how an increase in space debris would affect the reliability of future space missions.},

	journal={Electronics},
	volume={13},
	number={1},
	abstract={In recent years, the space industry has witnessed a resurgence, characterized by a notable proliferation of satellites operating at progressively lower altitudes, promising extensive global coverage and terrestrial-level data transfer speeds, while remaining cost-effective solutions. In particular, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can benefit from the wide coverage of space infrastructure due to their extensive deployment, disrupted communication nature, and the potential absence of terrestrial support. This study explored the utility of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations as a communication infrastructure for interconnecting "smart" devices via ground stations in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. To this end, we designed and implemented a series of experiments conducted within the OMNeT++ simulator, utilizing an updated iteration of the original Open Source Satellite Simulator (OS3) framework. Our research encompassed an IoT Case Study, incorporating authentic sensor data sourced from the Smart Santander testbed. Throughout our experimentation, we investigated the impact of the constellation design parameters such as the number of satellites and orbital planes, as well as the inter-satellite link configuration on the obtained Round-Trip Time (RTT) and packet loss rates.},

PSD is an Optical Position Sensor (OPS) that can measure a position of a radiation spot in one or two-dimensions on a sensor surface. Unlike discrete elements such as Charge-Coupled Device (CCD), it provides continuous position data, features high position resolution and high-speed response which give this paper its importance. The sensor used consists of two-dimensional array of photodiodes. The sensor has four output photocurrents that change according to the position of incident radiation on the surface. The work is divided into three parts of Modeling and Simulation; the first part is a single photodiode, Second part is one-dimensional array of photodiodes and the third one is two-dimensional array of photodiodes. The tool used to do the simulation is MATLAB software because it is professional and accurate tool, it has photodiode element and it is possible to control the beam of incident light. This research can be useful for Acquisition; Pointing and Tracking (APT) systems where this sensor will give the necessary data to do tracking operation. Proteus software was also been used as a secondary tool.},
