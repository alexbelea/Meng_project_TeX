\section{IoT Communication Enhancement with LEO Satellites}
The use of LEO satellites, including microsatellites, can be extended to the current expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 
To this end, Koukis and Tsaoussidis investigated the use of satellites for IoT sensors and devices. 
They created simulations using OMNeT++ software and real sensor data from Smart Santander testbed. 
They concluded that their initial hypothesis was correct, and an increase of LEO satellites is inversely proportional to ping loss and round-trip time of packets sent between a LEO constellation and IoT equipment on the ground. 
They also concluded that the placement of ground stations led to improved communication even with a lower number of satellites. 
They close by saying they did notice instances where signal was deteriorated, and that further work is necessary\cite{RefWorks:koukis2023satellite-assisted}.
