\paragraph{Photodiodes} produce a certain amount of current when light hits the depletion region. Therefore, a larger depletion region is desirable, to capture more light and in turn produce more current. For this purpose the photodiode in our circuit is reverse-biased as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:AltiumDis} \cite[p.155]{RefWorks:keiser2021fiber}.

\subsubsection{\acf{TIA}}
A reverse-biased photodiode allows a current to flow from the cathode to anode which is connected to ground. This current is converted to a Voltage using a \ac{TIA} with the following relationship derived as in Appendix Figure \ref{fig:Vo_deriv}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:TIAoutput} % Voltage output TIA
  \begin{split}
  V_{\text{out}} = - I_{\text{ph}} \cdot R_f
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Photocurrent} % Current photodiode formula
  \begin{split}
  I_{\text{ph}} = P \cdot R_{\lambda}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
\addequation{Photocurrent as Function of Optical Power}

Where $P$ is Light Power (W) and $R_{\lambda}$ is Responsivity (A/W).

\begin{equation} \label{eq:TIAoutputWithValues}
  \begin{split}
  V_{\text{out}} = -(P \cdot 0.5 \text{ A/W}) \cdot 1 \text{ M}\Omega
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
\addequation{TIA Output with Photodiode Response}

The \ac{TIA} circuit makes use of an \ac{OpAmp} as seen in Figure \ref{fig:AltiumDis} that provides very high imput impedance (1G$\Omega$) and allows the amplification of the signal without disturbing the photodiode current, therefore not affecting the readings. The inverting input is used in this configuration, which converts the negative current flowing from the cathode to the anode of the photodiode, into a positive voltage.

\subsubsection{Secondary Amplification}
\label{secondAmp}  
Testing showed that even using a 1M$\Omega$ resistor, the output voltage was too low (around 310mV) at our \ac{RED} testbench' \acp{LED} maximum brightness, as explained in Section \ref{explainPostAmp}. To raise the maximum Voltage to the desired maxium of the ADC of 5V, a higher feedback resistor could be used, however this would introduced noise and would require more complicated TIA with feedback capacitors. Due to the LM324-N having 4 \acp{OpAmp}, the decision was taken to implement a Secondary Amplification circuit. The non-inverting \ac{OpAmp} configuration was chosen to maintain the voltage positive, which also means there is no need for a dual power supply and keeps the Voltage positive for the Arduino ADC.
A simple calculation was made to figure out the required Gain of the circuit:
\begin{equation} \label{gainCalc}
  A = \frac{\text{required Voltage}}{\text{measured}} = \frac{5\text{ V}}{0.31\text{ V}} = 16.1
  \end{equation}
\addequation{Secondary Amplification Gain Calculation}

Knowing the gain required, the feedback resistor was calculated by choosing a 10k$\Omega R_1$ and rearranging the gain equation:

\begin{equation} \label{Feedback Resistor Calculation}
  \begin{split}
  A &= 1 + \frac{R_f}{R_1} \\
  16 &= 1 + \frac{R_f}{10\text{ k}\Omega} \\
  16 - 1 &= \frac{R_f}{10\text{ k}\Omega} \\
  15 &= \frac{R_f}{10\text{ k}\Omega} \\
  R_f &= 15 \times 10\text{ k}\Omega \\
  R_f &= 150\text{ k}\Omega
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
\addequation{Amplifier Feedback Resistor Calculation}

This provides a gain $A= 16$ which is very close to the Gain required in Equation \ref{gainCalc}. Further it must be stated that the resistors used have a tolerance of 10\% - therefore the actual final gain will fluctuate by that much. Once the design was tested on a BreadBoard, it was transfered to a stripboard as pictured in Figure \ref{fig:StripboardPhoto}.
Later in the design during testing, a decision was made to add a $1\mu$F capacitor in parallel with the feedback resistor of the Secondary Amplifier. This creates a low-pass filter on the output as seen in Eq. \ref{Low Pass Filter Calculation}.
\begin{equation} \label{Low Pass Filter Calculation}
  \begin{split}
    f_c &= \frac{1}{2\pi RC} \\
    f_c &= \frac{1}{2\pi \cdot 150\text{ k}\Omega \cdot 1\text{ }\mu\text{F}} \\
    f_c &= \frac{1}{2\pi \cdot 150 \cdot 10^3 \cdot 1 \cdot 10^{-6}\text{ s}} \\
    f_c &= \frac{1}{2\pi \cdot 150 \cdot 10^{-3}\text{ s}} \\
    f_c &= \frac{1}{0.942\text{ s}} \\
    f_c &= 1.061\text{ Hz}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
\addequation{Secondary Amplification Low Pass Filter Calculation}

This does mean that we are now restricting the design to not be able to show Voltage change rates at higher than 1Hz, and testing with a moving light source will have to be restricted to a frequency at least half of 1Hz. Otherwise, the rate of change of Voltage will appear gradual and not represent the real signal.
